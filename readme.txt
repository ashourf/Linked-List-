   The program compiled and ran succesfully. Every list function works to my knowledge but sometimes the test menu can create odd behaviorthat I can't pin down. 
   
   The program was developed and tested on Arch linux 4.18.6. Using kdevelop and gcc version 8.2.1.  It was 
   compiled, run, and tested on csegrid.ucdenver.pvt.
